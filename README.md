# SilentFetcher

SilentFetcher aims to reduce that programmers write common error handling several times.

It ignores errors which are commonly handled (and often be ignored) when fetching URL and has also an ability to parse HTML/RSS, using [nokogiri](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri) and [feedjira](https://github.com/feedjira/feedjira).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'silent_fetcher'
